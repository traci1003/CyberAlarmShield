🔐 Cybersecurity Alarm Clock – Full Concept

An alarm clock app that does more than just wake you up — it protects your phone while you sleep and helps you start the day safely.
🧱 Features Breakdown:
🕒 Smart Alarm Functionality

    Set alarms with tones, vibrations, or voice recordings

    Sleep schedule and nap modes

    Math captcha or "cyber drills" to dismiss alarm (anti-snooze mode)

    Sleep analytics (optional)

🔐 Cyber Hygiene Before You Wake Up

Before or after you wake up, the app runs lightweight cybersecurity tasks:
Task	Description
App Scan	Scans your installed apps for known malicious packages
Network Check	Detects if you're connected to a risky Wi-Fi (man-in-the-middle or fake access points)
Malware Wake Scan	Checks device for abnormal background processes
Privacy Reminder	Morning recap: which apps accessed mic/camera overnight
Phishing Drill (optional)	“1-question challenge”: shows a fake link/email — you guess if it’s legit
Patch Reminder	Alerts you of recent security updates you haven’t installed
🔑 Wake with Awareness

    First screen when you wake shows:

        📊 Your device health score (0-100)

        🔍 “Security Tip of the Day”

        🚨 Alert if something suspicious was detected overnight

🌐 Bonus Features:

    VPN toggle at bedtime (auto-activate your preferred VPN while you sleep)

    Auto lock-down mode (disables unknown background activity from 12am–6am)

    Battery-safe mode while scanning
